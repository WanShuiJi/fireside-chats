    <h3><strong><i>Franklin Delano Roosevelt giving one of his Fireside Chats</i></strong></h3>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><b>Over the twelve year period from 1933-1945, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt recorded 30 informal radio
      broadcasts
      called "Fireside Chats'' to speak with the American people about topics including his New Deal, the Great
      Depression
      and WWII to instill confidence and calmness during the tumultuous time period.</b>
    They made the public feel like the president himself was talking to them, next to their fireplace.
    The effectiveness of his Fireside Chats inspired other presidents to use electronic devices like radio and TV to
    connect
    with the public and gain support for their agendas. Examples include Jimmy Carter, John F. Kennedy, and more
    recently
    wuth the invention of social media, presidents such as Donald Trump.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> The reason why I chose to create a website about the Fireside chats is because I'm very familiar with them. I
    studied
    about FDR and the Great Depression during the NHD (National History Day) Project, and ever since then every
    historical
    paper I have had to write, I choose to write about about FDR and the Fireside Chats.</p>
