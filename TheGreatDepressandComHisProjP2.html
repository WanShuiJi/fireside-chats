<center><h6>Presidental Communication Before FDR</h6></center></a>
<br>
<center><p>Before Franklin Roosevelt, many presidents already had their own way to communicate with the public. 
Lincoln had a talent for written word, but he first made himself seen as a gifted debater in a time when
 you have to communicate with people through debates. Many people would come to these events. 
Lincoln was the first president to have installed a telegraph, and would send messages frequently. 
Teddy Roosevelt was known for quips and catchy slogans during his presidency such as, speak softly and carry a big stick.
 He’s the first president to define his agenda in a single wording, <b>”A square deal for the rich and the poor, 
the capitalist and the wage worker”.</b></p>

      <h4>During the 1930’s things were not going so well for the United States. 
Americans were going through the greatest economic struggle of their country's history: The Great Depression.  
It was caused by surpluses of goods, and too few buyers. What made it even worse were the tariffs that the government 
imposed to keep non American goods out of the country. This meant that America couldn't sell its surplus of goods to 
other countries. Many people became bankrupt and so did companies and it led to all time high unemployment. 
Many were homeless and hungry: Americans were suffering and they didn't know what to do.</h4>

<h5><b><i>Living during the Great Depression was rough. Many people didn't have the money to buy food and had to line up to get it. 
Community kitchens like this one would give away foodstuffs such soup, donuts, coffee, etc. 
People would usually only get one serving per day.</b></i></h5>
