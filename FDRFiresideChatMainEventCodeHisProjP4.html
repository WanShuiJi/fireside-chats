            <p>From 1933-1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt sent out 30 informal chats to the American people.
                  Coined the “Fireside Chats” by reporter Harry Butcher, They were meant to calm the American people,
                  inspire them to keep pushing, and get them through the Depression. It almost seems like a coincidence
                  that the golden age of radio was during the Fireside Chats. The radio helped Roosevelt talk to the
                  entire
                  country at once. Why not the press? Roosevelt didn't like the press because of the way that publishers
                  could change things. He called them poisonous propaganda. When Roosevelt talked to you, it felt like
                  he was actually speaking to you next to a Fireplace. When he broadcasted a Fireside chat he would
                  imagine
                  he was talking to a farmer or a girl and start out with- "my friends". Afterward, the Fireside Chats
                  would
                  convince people to support war efforts.</p>

            <p><b>The impact of these chats was not to be underestimated.</b>
                  The Fireside chats raised morale and boosted confidence by a large margin.
                  The chats calmed the American people. In fact, the iconic picture of the
                  Great Depression became a family, sitting around radio listening, as Roosevelt
                  talked. Combined with the new deal, the great depression finally ended.</p>

      <br>
      <center>
            <p>Even after the chats stopped, their impact still lives on. The innovation
                  and effectiveness of the chats inspired many other presidents to try electronical
                  devices to communicate with the public. Jimmy Carter did a similar type fireside
                  chat, wearing a sweater next to a fireplace talking to the public. Ronald Reagan
                  did a weekly radio chat to talk to the public.
